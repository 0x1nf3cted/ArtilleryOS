9. [ ] Implement process creation, termination, and context switching.
10. [ ] Develop a scheduler for CPU time allocation.
11. [ ] Support inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.
12. [ ] Handle multi-threading (if needed).

## Device Drivers and Hardware Support
13. [ ] Write device drivers for essential hardware components (e.g., keyboard, display, storage devices).
14. [ ] Develop a driver model for managing and communicating with hardware devices.
15. [ ] Implement interrupt handling for hardware events.
16. [ ] Ensure hardware compatibility and stability.

## System Calls and User Space
17. [ ] Define a set of system calls for user programs to interact with the kernel.
18. [ ] Implement a system call handler to process user requests.
19. [ ] Support standard POSIX system calls (if desired).
20. [ ] Develop a user-space environment with user programs and libraries.
21. [ ] Implement a shell or command-line interface for user interaction.

## File Systems (if applicable)
22. [ ] Choose or create a file system architecture (e.g., FAT, ext4).
23. [ ] Implement file I/O, directory management, and file operations.
24. [ ] Support file permissions and access control.

## Security
25. [ ] Implement security measures for access control and privilege levels.
26. [ ] Protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows).
27. [ ] Ensure secure memory management.
28. [ ] Support secure boot procedures (if applicable).

## Error Handling and Testing
29. [ ] Create test cases to verify the correctness of kernel components.
30. [ ] Use testing frameworks and automated testing tools.
31. [ ] Test on real hardware and emulation environments (e.g., QEMU).
32. [ ] Implement error handling and logging mechanisms.

## Optimization and Performance
33. [ ] Profile and optimize critical kernel components for better performance.
34. [ ] Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) and identify bottlenecks.
35. [ ] Optimize memory allocation and deallocation.

## Documentation and Community
36. [ ] Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout the project.
37. [ ] Document kernel internals, APIs, and usage instructions for contributors and users.
38. [ ] Foster a community of contributors and users.
39. [ ] Set up communication channels for collaboration and support.
40. [ ] Encourage contributions and manage pull requests.

## Project Management and Clean-up

42. [ ] Track project progress and adjust plans as needed.
43. [ ] Regularly review and refactor code for readability and maintainability.
44. [ ] Remove deprecated or unused code.
45. [ ] Address code smells and potential issues.
46. [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with previous kernel versions (if applicable).

## Miscellaneous and Future Enhancements
47. [ ] Support additional hardware platforms or architectures.
48. [ ] Implement advanced features (e.g., symmetric multiprocessing, real-time support).
49. [ ] Explore energy efficiency and power management.

## Conclusion
This detailed `TODO.md` file provides a prioritized roadmap for developing of Artillery OS. Regularly update and prioritize tasks as the project progresses, and adapt the list to align with evolving requirements and priorities.
